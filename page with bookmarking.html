         M. M. Keeravani, while the cinematography, production design, and VFX were handled by K. K. Senthil Kumar, Sabu Cyril 
         and V. Srinivas Mohan respectively.

        themes, action sequences, music, and performances,and became a record-breaking box office success. It was also praised 
        by the actors of the film industry and, along with its successor, is widely regarded as one of the greatest Indian epic
